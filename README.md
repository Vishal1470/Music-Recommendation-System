1️⃣Project Title Music Recommendation System 🎶

2️⃣ Project Description this project is a machine learning-based music recommendation system that suggests similar songs based on the lyrics It uses the Spotify Millsong Dataset, applies TF-IDF Vectorization and Cosine Similarity for precise recommendations. Built with Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit for an interactive web interface.

Key Features ✅ Enter a song name, get similar recommendations 🎼 ✅ Uses Collaborative Filtering & Content-Based Filtering ✅ Built with Python, Pandas, NLTK, and Scikit-Learn ✅ Interactive UI (Optional: ex. Streamlit)

3️⃣ Tech Stack Used 📌 Programming Language: Python 🐍 📌 Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, NLTK, Scikit-Learn 📌 Algorithms: Cosine Similarity, TF-IDF, Collaborative Filtering 📌 Dataset: Million Song Dataset / Any suitable dataset 📌 Deployment (Optional): Flask / Streamlit

4️⃣ Installation Guide 🚀 🔹 Step 1: Clone the Repository git clone https://github.com/Vishal1470/music-recommendation-system.git cd music-recommendation-system

🔹 Step 2: Install Dependencies pip install -r requirements.txt

🔹 Step 3: Run the Project If it's a Jupyter Notebook, open it using:

jupyter notebook If you're running a Flask/Streamlit App, use:
python app.py
5️⃣ How It Works? 🛠️ 1️⃣ User inputs a song name 2️⃣ The system analyzes song features using NLP & ML models 3️⃣ Generates recommendations based on similarity score 4️⃣ User gets a list of similar songs to explore 🎧

6️⃣ Example Output Input: "Shape of You - Ed Sheeran" Recommendations: 🎵 Perfect - Ed Sheeran 🎵 Closer - The Chainsmokers 🎵 Let Me Love You - DJ Snake ft. Justin Bieber

7️⃣ Future Improvements 🚀 🔹 Add deep learning models for better recommendations 🔹 Integrate Spotify API for real-time song data 🔹 Create a mobile app version of the system
